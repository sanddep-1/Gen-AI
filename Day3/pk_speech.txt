‘Don’t expect patriotism from Bollywood’: Pawan kalyan
Pawan Kalyan urged people, especially the youth, to take inspiration from the sacrifices of Indian soldiers rather than from film stars.
Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister and popular actor Pawan Kalyan’s powerful speech during the Tiranga Yatra in Vijayawada on Friday evening is making waves on social media. Standing beside Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, Pawan strongly criticised both Pakistan and Bollywood stars.

Speaking to a large crowd, Pawan Kalyan blamed Pakistan for supporting terrorism and recalled past attacks. “Pakistan was behind the bomb blasts in Coimbatore and Hyderabad. But with Operation Sindoor, our armed forces gave a strong answer,” he said. “The entire country must support our soldiers.”

He also questioned the silence of Bollywood actors after the Pahalgam terror attack and India’s response through Operation Sindoor. “Bollywood stars didn’t say a word about Operation Sindoor. Don’t expect patriotism from them. They are only entertainers. Real heroes are martyrs like Murali Nayak who gave their lives for the nation,” he said.

Pawan Kalyan urged people, especially the youth, to take inspiration from the sacrifices of Indian soldiers rather than from film stars. His emotional speech has struck a chord with many across the country and is being widely shared online.

The Tiranga Yatra, held to show unity and respect for the nation, saw huge public participation.
