There are few figures in Indian history who have caught the nation’s imagination quite like Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. Today, I want to take you through the remarkable journey of a boy from a small island town who became not just India’s President, but its conscience keeper and inspiration.

Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam’s early life was a study in humility and perseverance. His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and imam, while his mother, Ashiamma, was a homemaker. Though his ancestors had been wealthy traders, by the time Kalam was born, the family had lost most of their fortune. Yet, this financial hardship never deterred young Kalam from pursuing his dreams.

His academic journey was marked by curiosity and dedication. At Madras Institute of Technology, there’s a famous story of how he met an impossible deadline for his senior project when his scholarship was at stake. This incident exemplified what would become his life’s philosophy – facing challenges head-on with dedication and innovation.

Kalam’s scientific career spans over four decades of service to the nation. At DRDO and ISRO, he was not just a scientist but a visionary leader. Under his guidance, India developed its first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), marking our entry into the space age. The success of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, which gave India strategic missiles like Agni and Prithvi, established him as the “Missile Man of India.”

But what truly set Kalam apart was his vision of development. He wasn’t just focused on military capability; he believed in using technology for social good. The development of the Kalam-Raju stent and tablet demonstrated his commitment to making healthcare accessible to all Indians. His role in India’s nuclear programs, particularly the Pokhran-II tests, was crucial in establishing India’s position as a nuclear power.

As the 11th President of India, Kalam brought a unique dimension to the office. Known as the “People’s President,” he transformed Rashtrapati Bhavan from a symbol of power to a center of inspiration. He connected with people, especially children, with an authenticity rarely seen in public life. His vision for India, encapsulated in his books and speeches, went beyond economic metrics to encompass what he called “developed India 2020” – a nation strong in technology, anchored in values.

What made Kalam extraordinary was his ability to inspire. His interaction with students wasn’t just about sharing knowledge; it was about igniting minds. He believed that “dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action.” His messages were simple yet profound: dream big, work hard, and maintain integrity.

Even after his presidency, Kalam chose to serve the nation through teaching and public speaking. He lived modestly, owned few personal possessions, and dedicated himself to inspiring the youth. His sudden passing on July 27, 2015, while addressing students at IIM Shillong, was perhaps the most fitting departure for a man who lived to teach and inspire.

Dr. Kalam’s legacy isn’t just in the missiles he helped build or the policies he shaped as President. It lives in the countless young minds he inspired, in the dream of a developed India he nurtured, and in the values he exemplified – simplicity, integrity, and dedication to the nation.

As we remember Dr. Kalam today, let us carry forward his vision of an India that leads in technology while staying rooted in values, an India where knowledge and innovation drive progress, and most importantly, an India where every citizen dreams big and works tirelessly to achieve those dreams.
